<h1 align="center">DWA_11.3 Challenge 1</h1>

##

<p>For this challenge, you will be required to use the two supplied video lessons as a reference to create your own implementation of a Redux-inspired store to manage the state of a basic counting Tally App. Note that you are not required to render any HTML to the screen, but instead should add subscriptions that merely log the new state to the console if it changes.</p>

GIVEN no interactions have been performed yet
WHEN the “getState” method is run

SCENARIO: Increment the counter by one

GIVEN no interactions have been performed yet
WHEN an “ADD” action is dispatched
AND another “ADD” action is dispatched
AND the browser console is open
THEN the state should show a count of 2
SCENARIO: Increment the counter by one
